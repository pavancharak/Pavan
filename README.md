### 🧠 Product + Tech Focus
- Translating business problems into **technical product requirements**
- Designing **AI-first user journeys** (onboarding, activation, trust & safety)
- Defining **success metrics, guardrails, and experimentation frameworks**
- Partnering with Engineering, Data, and ML teams on system design

---

### 🔧 Tools & Tech Stack
- **Languages**: **Python** (data analysis, scripting), SQL  
- **GenAI / ML**: LLMs, Prompt Engineering, RAG, Embeddings, Vector Search  
- **Frameworks**: LangChain, LlamaIndex (basics)  
- **Data & Analytics**: Funnel Analysis, Cohort Analysis, A/B Testing  
- **APIs & Systems**: REST APIs, Webhooks, Auth flows, Rate limiting  
- **Infra (working knowledge)**: Cloud basics (AWS/GCP), CI/CD concepts  
- **Product Tooling**: Mixpanel, GA, Jira, Notion  

---

### 🚀 Featured Projects (Systems Thinking)

#### 🧠 Local LLM Evaluation & Selection System
- Built a **local evaluation harness** to compare open-source LLMs on quality, latency, memory, and cost
- Designed prompts, test sets, and qualitative scoring rubrics for real product use cases
- Documented **model trade-offs** to inform deployment decisions

**System focus:** model selection, performance constraints, evaluation frameworks

---

#### 🔎 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Knowledge System
- Designed an **end-to-end RAG architecture**: ingestion → chunking → embeddings → retrieval → generation
- Implemented grounding, citation strategies, and fallback logic to reduce hallucinations
- Defined success metrics: answer accuracy, retrieval precision, response latency

**System focus:** reliability, correctness, failure handling

---

#### 🔌 API-first GenAI Platform
- Designed a **service-oriented GenAI API layer** exposing LLM capabilities to multiple clients
- Defined request contracts, auth assumptions, error taxonomies, and rate-limit policies
- Planned extensibility via model swaps, versioning, and observability hooks

**System focus:** scalability, DX, platform thinking

---

#### 📊 Growth Experimentation & Measurement System
- Built an experimentation system linking product changes to user behavior and business outcomes
- Defined funnels, cohorts, and guardrails to prevent metric gaming
- Documented rollout, rollback, and iteration decision rules

**System focus:** decision-making systems, not dashboards
